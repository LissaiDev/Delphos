# SOLID Principles Implementation in Delphos Server

This document explains how the refactored Delphos Server codebase adheres to SOLID principles, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.

## Overview

The refactoring focused on creating a more maintainable, testable, and extensible codebase while maintaining backward compatibility. The changes were made with a minimalistic approach to avoid over-engineering.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Before**: Classes and functions had multiple responsibilities mixed together.

**After**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.

#### Key Changes:

- **Application Class** (`cmd/main.go`):
  - **Before**: Main function handled broker creation, HTTP setup, monitoring, and server startup
  - **After**: `Application` class focuses solely on application orchestration

- **StatsService** (`internal/monitor/monitor.go`):
  - **Before**: Functions mixed data collection with logging
  - **After**: `StatsService` focuses only on system statistics collection and management

- **Configuration Service** (`internal/config/service.go`):
  - **Before**: Configuration loading mixed with validation and defaults
  - **After**: Separate methods for loading, validation, and accessing configuration

- **Middleware Chain** (`internal/api/chain.go`):
  - **Before**: Manual middleware chaining in main function
  - **After**: Dedicated `MiddlewareChain` class for managing middleware composition

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Implementation**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Key Features:

- **Middleware System**: New middleware can be added without modifying existing code
- **Configuration Service**: New configuration sources can be added by extending the service
- **Stats Collection**: New monitoring metrics can be added by extending the service
- **Logger Interfaces**: New logging implementations can be added without changing existing code

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Implementation**: Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without breaking functionality.

#### Key Features:

- **Logger Interfaces**: All logger implementations can be substituted seamlessly
- **Response Writers**: Custom response writers extend the base `http.ResponseWriter` interface
- **Configuration Providers**: Different configuration sources implement the same interface

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Before**: Large interfaces with many methods that clients didn't need.

**After**: Smaller, focused interfaces that clients can implement as needed.

#### Key Changes:

- **Logger Interfaces** (`pkg/logger/interfaces.go`):
  ```go
  // Instead of one large Logger interface, we have:
  type BasicLogger interface {
      Debug(message string, fields ...map[string]interface{})
      Info(message string, fields ...map[string]interface{})
      Warn(message string, fields ...map[string]interface{})
      Error(message string, fields ...map[string]interface{})
      Fatal(message string, fields ...map[string]interface{})
  }
  
  type FieldLogger interface {
      BasicLogger
      WithFields(fields map[string]interface{}) FieldLogger
  }
  
  type ConfigurableLogger interface {
      SetLevel(level Level)
      SetFormatter(formatter Formatter)
      AddHandler(handler Handler)
  }
  ```

- **System Interfaces** (`internal/interfaces/interfaces.go`):
  - `StatsProvider`: Only for statistics collection
  - `MessageBroker`: Only for message broadcasting
  - `ConfigProvider`: Only for configuration access

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Before**: High-level modules depended on low-level modules.

**After**: Both depend on abstractions (interfaces).

#### Key Changes:

- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive their dependencies through constructors
- **Interface Dependencies**: Classes depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Service Container** (`internal/container/container.go`): Manages dependency creation and injection

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Implementation

### 1. Response Writer Helper

**Before**: Multiple response writer implementations with duplicated code.

**After**: Single `ResponseWriter` helper (`internal/api/response.go`):

```go
type ResponseWriter struct {
    http.ResponseWriter
    StatusCode   int
    ResponseSize int
}
```

### 2. Middleware Logging Functions

**Before**: Duplicated logging code across middleware functions.

**After**: Centralized logging helpers (`internal/api/middleware.go`):

```go
func logRequestStart(r *http.Request)
func logRequestComplete(r *http.Request, rw *ResponseWriter, duration time.Duration)
func logRequestError(r *http.Request, rw *ResponseWriter)
// ... and more
```

### 3. Stats Collection

**Before**: Repeated logging patterns in each monitor function.

**After**: Unified collection methods in `StatsService`:

```go
func (s *StatsService) collectHostInfo() (*Host, error)
func (s *StatsService) collectMemoryInfo() (*Memory, error)
func (s *StatsService) collectCPUInfo() ([]*CPU, error)
// ... consistent pattern for all collectors
```

### 4. Header Setting

**Before**: Duplicated header setting code.

**After**: Centralized header functions:

```go
func setCORSHeaders(w http.ResponseWriter)
func setSecurityHeaders(w http.ResponseWriter)
func setStreamingCORSHeaders(w http.ResponseWriter)
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. Maintainability
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Clear Separation**: Concerns are clearly separated
- **Modular Design**: Components can be modified independently

### 2. Testability
- **Dependency Injection**: Easy to mock dependencies for testing
- **Interface-based Design**: Can substitute test implementations
- **Focused Classes**: Easier to write unit tests for specific functionality

### 3. Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: New middleware, loggers, and monitors can be added easily
- **Configuration System**: New configuration sources can be plugged in
- **Interface-based**: New implementations can be added without changing existing code

### 4. Reusability
- **Common Helpers**: Shared functionality is centralized
- **Interface Compatibility**: Components can be reused across different contexts
- **Modular Components**: Services can be used independently

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:

- **Global Variables**: `config.Env` and `logger.Log` still work as before
- **Function Signatures**: Existing functions maintain their original signatures
- **API Endpoints**: All HTTP endpoints remain unchanged
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and .env files work as before
